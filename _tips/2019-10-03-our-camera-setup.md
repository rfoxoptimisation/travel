Currently, Ryan is travelling with

- Sony A6400

Lenses:

- Sony 16-50mm F3.5-5.6 kit lens
- Sony 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 zoom lens
- Sigma 16mm F1.4 prime lens

On previous trips, I've travelled with the Sony A6000 with just the kit lens and this has been amazing for me. See some sample shots in the gallery here.

However, after losing my camera on a bus, I fell down the rabbit hole looking into mirrorless cameras and their lenses. First of all I had to choose which camera to get as a replacement. For a long time it was between the old reliable Sony A6000 and the Panasonic GX9. After ruling out the GX9, I then decided to upgrade from the A6000 to the A6400 in the belief that I might do some videos.

My reasoning was that the larger APS-C sensor would result in higher quality imagery. However, in reality, I'm sure I would've been very happy with the Panasonic GX9. My research process is not very technical, I simply do searches for 'best camera', 'best travel camera' and often 'best mirrorless camera' as I like mirrorless cameras for their size. Further, I'm no pro and therefore do not need the best of the best. I need whatever I'm going to be happy with.

The Sony alpha range served me very well in the A6400 and so far it is serving me incredibly well in the A6400. I'm very happy with my choice and have decided to invest further into the camera with some lenses.

## Why not just use the kit lens?

This is a great question. Look at a bunch of videos online and you'll see a lot of people be negative about the Sony 16-50mm kit lens. I used it for a few years and loved it. 16-50mm is a great range to be getting on with and I really think many people will be happy using this.

There are lots of advantages to sticking with the kit lens.

- price - new lenses can be pricey and the kit lens is inexpensive
- size - the kit lens is small and the whole point of having a mirrorless camera is for it to be portable
- discreet - the lens on the alpha series cameras makes the outfit small and discreet, you won't attract too much attention when you pull this out
- one lens - having more lenses sometimes means you have to faff around with carrying more lenses and then swapping them over when you want to use the different ones

So why am I not just sticking with the kit lens?

- better focal range - I wanted to have a wider range to get closer to scenery, nature, cut out unwanted subjects in photos
- low light performance - the 3.5 maximum aperture on the kit lens means that the lens is not great in low light such as night photography or astrophotography
- sharpness in corners - I feel the kit lens lacks sharpness in corners
- sharpness generally - maybe this isn't something I would've noticed without doing the research but other lenses just give you a better sharpness
- better background separation or bokeh - this is the cinematic effect you get where your background is blurry allowing for better focus on the main subject of your photo
